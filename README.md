# Maximal Matching Empirical Analysis

* matching.py creates random graphs, then runs ROG-MM and the Blossom algorithm on them
* matchingscript.ipynb uses the same code as matching.py to run the algorithms, and then graphs the results inmultiple ways
* extra-matchinganalysis.py runs the analysis on d-regular graphs
* GraphResults contains some graphs from our analysis
